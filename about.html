                        day</a>. How cool is that.
                    This diplome is the result of a 4-year apprenticeship in Application Development in Lucerne,
                    Switzerland.

                    Speaking of Switzerland, I was born here, however, lived and raised in Hungary.

                    During my four years as a student in IT, I developed a fondness towards Linux systems, a passion for
                    Information Security and the ever-growing topic of concern: personal privacy in the IT world.

                <p>
                    I am a huge advocate for privacy preserving tech, and promote its usage in my family circle and
                    under
                    firends. I want to reach beyond that, so I am looking towards participating in projects,
                    events and working with like-minded individuals on this topic.
